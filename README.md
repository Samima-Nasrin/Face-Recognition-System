## Introduction

This Face Recognition System identifies human faces using machine learning algorithms. It detects faces in real-time from a webcam feed or from an image file and compares the detected face with a pre-existing dataset to identify the person.

## Features

- **Real-time face detection** using OpenCV.
- **Face recognition** through machine learning algorithms.
- Supports **image-based face recognition**.
- Easy integration and extensibility with different datasets.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: The programming language used for the project.
- **OpenCV**: Library for image processing and face detection.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Includes techniques like KNN, SVM, and deep learning for face recognition.
- **Haar Cascade Classifier**: For face detection.
- **CSV**: Used to store the attendance list in CSV format.
